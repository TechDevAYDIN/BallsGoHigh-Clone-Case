# BallsGoHigh-Clone-Case
A clone project of balls go high game.
I created this project in just one day as a case study to showcase my skills in Unity and C#. I also added a sea shader that I had previously developed, which gives the game a cartoonistic and dynamic water effect. However, the project is not perfect, as some of the models I used have issues that can affect the gameplay. For example, some balls can get stuck in the platforms or bounce unpredictably. Therefore, this project is more of a proof of concept than a polished product.
